## Recent Development Focus

Based on our recent development efforts, we've been focusing on:

1. **Cross-Environment Testing** - Ensuring tests work properly in both:
   - Development environment (macOS with Apple Silicon)
   - Production environment (Linux with NVIDIA GPUs)

2. **Test Infrastructure Improvements**:
   - Fixed compatibility issues in test files
   - Updated test functions to match actual implementation
   - Created environment-aware tests that skip when appropriate
   - Added comprehensive test coverage for error handling

3. **Logging and Debugging**:
   - Unified logging system between frontend and backend
   - Improved error handling and reporting
   - Better diagnostic information for troubleshooting

4. **Frontend Improvements**:
   - Fixed download form functionality
   - Improved UI responsiveness
   - Enhanced error feedback to users

## Known Issues

1. **Memory Usage**: High memory usage with multiple large models loaded simultaneously
2. **Startup Time**: Slow startup time for very large models (>70B parameters)
3. **Error Handling**: Inconsistent error handling in some edge cases
4. **UI Responsiveness**: Frontend can become unresponsive during heavy operations
5. **Test Environment**: Some tests only run in specific environments

## Persistent Issues Needing Follow-up

These issues have been persistent and require additional attention:

1. **Test Compatibility Issues**:
   - ✅ Fixed import errors in test files
   - ✅ Updated test files to match the current API implementation
   - 🟡 Some tests still skipped due to complex mocking requirements

2. **Environment-Specific Code**:
   - Better handling of environment differences (Apple Silicon vs. NVIDIA)
   - More robust detection and adaptation to available hardware
   - Cleaner separation of environment-specific code

3. **Frontend-Backend Integration**:
   - Improve error propagation from backend to frontend
   - Enhance real-time status updates during long-running operations
   - Better handling of concurrent requests

4. **Documentation Gaps**:
   - Missing documentation for API endpoints
   - Lack of deployment guides for different environments
   - Insufficient troubleshooting information

5. **Stress Testing**:
   - Need more comprehensive stress tests for production environment
   - Better simulation of high-load scenarios
   - Long-running stability tests

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Priorities**:
   - ✅ Fixed test issues in `test_download_error_handling.py`, `test_security.py`, and `test_concurrency.py`
   - 🟡 Add pytest-asyncio plugin to support async tests
   - 🟡 Implement better mocking for Ray and Serve in tests
   - 🟡 Add proper error handling for model download failures

2. **Short-term Goals** (Next 2-4 weeks):
   - Improve error handling throughout the application
   - Enhance frontend UI with better responsiveness and error feedback
   - Implement advanced monitoring features
   - Complete multi-GPU support for all model types

3. **Medium-term Goals** (1-3 months):
   - Improve documentation with more examples and deployment guides
   - Implement automated CI/CD pipeline for testing
   - Add comprehensive logging and monitoring
   - Create deployment templates for common environments

## Project Timeline

- **Q1 2025**: Core functionality and testing (Completed)
- **Q2 2025**: Stability improvements, advanced features, and documentation
- **Q3 2025**: Scaling features, distributed deployment, and containerization
- **Q4 2025**: Security enhancements, fine-tuning capabilities, and production hardening
